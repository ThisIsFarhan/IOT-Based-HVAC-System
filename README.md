# 🔧 PID Temperature Control System with ESP32 and Arduino Cloud

This project implements a real-time PID controller on an ESP32 to maintain a desired temperature using a DHT22 sensor. A fan and bulb are controlled via PWM to regulate heating and cooling, while the system can be monitored and adjusted through an Arduino Cloud-based Android app.

## 📱 Features
- PID controller developed from scratch
- Real-time temperature control with DHT22
- Fan & bulb control based on error correction
- WiFi connectivity for cloud integration
- Android app for setpoint and gain tuning
